# Channel Playlists for Youtube
 A lightweight extension for Youtube that redirects the browser to a playlist of all a channel's videos. This functionality used to be available on the website, but it was removed for some reason. The playlists still exist, but accessing them requires some tedious url manipulation, which this extension handles.

 Instructions:
 Click the extension icon while on a video page or channel page.

This extension is available for download on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/channel-playlists-for-you/nfmbnooehmepkbcpalefdmonflkfjglf?authuser=0&hl=en&pli=1) and [Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/channel-playlists-for-you/pbojmeocfpiopgjbodhddlagebefbmjb).
